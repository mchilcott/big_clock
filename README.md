# Big Clock

This project is for a large 7-segment clock made from a series of
WS2812 LEDs. This project also uses an OLED display, 3 buttons, and a
DS1307 real-time clock.

The real-time clock keeps actual time, but the main purpose of this clock is as a count-down timer for talks at the IONS KOALA 2019 conference.
