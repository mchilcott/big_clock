This will probably work, but I was tired at the time....
There is possibly more scope for using the fact that it's not actually a 7 segment display, but oh well.
Inspiration from

but this list is vastly better.

Note S/5, Z/2 double ups. Nothing else doubles up? uvw, nm quite indistinguishable though
